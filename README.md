# Note_Taker

## Intoduction
This is the README for the Note Taker Refactor of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains the various assets required to make a server and a site for a note taker application. These files were supplied to me through a Gitlab repo so that I could refactor to make the application function through a combination of server js, express, and other apis.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to cement my knowledge about express, fs, and path. I was also able to learn how to troubleshoot the backend of applications and use json more effectively.
